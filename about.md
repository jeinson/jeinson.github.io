I am a bioinformatics PhD student in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](http://www.dbmi.columbia.edu), and a member of the [Lappalainen Lab](http://www.tllab.org){:target="_blank_"} at the [New York Genome Center](http://www.nygenome.org){:target="_blank_"}. I currently live in New York City, but am from Massachusetts and lived there until after graduating from college.

## Research
Broadly, I am excited by the modern integration of computer science, statistics, and biology in the interdisciplenary field of bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is sometimes classified as a subfield of "Biomedical Informatics," which aims to interpret large data sets from all areas of healthcare, from population wide observation studies, to molecular interactions in disease systems. [More on this here](https://dbmi.columbia.edu). Personally, I am most interested in the tiny datapoints inside our genomes, which can now be studied with the power of next-generation sequencing. In the Lappalainen lab, we study how the biological mechanisms of how genetic variation produces the diversity we see in the population. I use statistical models and ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ *machine learning* ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ based approaches.

My scientific career started in college, when I worked in the [Sela Lab](https://selalab.org) studying microbial community ecology in food processing systems, primarily by analyzing 16S sequencing data.
