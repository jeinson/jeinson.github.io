At some point in one's academic career, the decision arises on whether to start applying for industry jobs, or to continue on with a post-doc. 
While I am not opposed to the idea of continuing my research experience in an industry position, I think the market has progressed to a stage
where it is a bit of a foolish move at this point to go into academia if you don't think of applying for faculty positions in the future.
