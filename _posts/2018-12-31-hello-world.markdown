Hello World! This is my first real blog post on my personal webpage. It seems like a good PhD student should have their own page for professionalism and such. If you made it here, thanks for visiting!

I made this site in the time I had after the Fall Semester of 2018, and when the Spring semester of 2019 began. Holiday week is sometimes unproductive, but learning how to make a website has proven to be a worth while use of my time.
