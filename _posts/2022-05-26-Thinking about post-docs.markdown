At some point in one's PhD career, the decision arises on whether to start applying for industry jobs, or to continue on with a post-doc. 
While I am not opposed to the idea of continuing my research experience in an industry position, I think the market has progressed to a stage
where it is a bit of a foolish move at this point to go into academia if you don't think of applying for faculty positions in the future. The advice I have received is virtually unanimous: 
if you don't have your heart set on being a PI, then doing a post-doc isn't worth it. You work
much harder and get paid way less than you would going into an industry job. 
Now I think when academics hear "industry," they think of working for a pharma company or selling
your soul to some immoral machine. I don't agree with this sentiment, after speaking with other 
people who have gone this path, and from reading countless job descriptions of jobs that require
a PhD as a baseline. Why can't we say we're "going into enterprise?" That sounds a lot nicer.
